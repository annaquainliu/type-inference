# Type Inference

This is an educational website that demonstrates how type inference works in Nano-ML. Users can type in any expression/definition and observe how generalization, instantiation, type substitution, Gamma, and constraint solving work behind the hood.

I could've made another operational semantic deriver for Nano-ML, but I wanted a more user-intuitive interface to display the interpreter logic of functional languages.

Enjoy!
